# Introduction

This project is designed to assist artists with creating content for the media wall at Phoenix Cinema and Arts Centre, Leicester, UK. They are split into two sections, the Unity 2022(LTS) Sample, and the Unity 2022(LTS) Template. You can find the documentation for the Javascript web sample here: https://github.com/PhoenixDigiArt/media-wall-webapp-sample.

In this repository, there are two options for your project, the Media-Wall Sample source code and the Media Wall Package (Found in the GitHub repository Releases page), and as the name suggests, the sample includes sample scenes with custom code. In contrast, the package installs the required functionality into your own project.

This document should be used as a guide on using the Media-Wall plugin for Unity, which can be downloaded as a Unity Package file from the repository releases page. To learn about Unity, please refer to the Unity Learn and Unity Documentation web pages for guidance.

# Recommendations

The Phoenix-Media-Wall package was built for Unity version 2022(LTS) and it is recommended that you use this version. All other Unity versions are untested and there may be unexpected errors with no documented solutions if you choose to use a different Unity build.

The bodytracking in this sample expects the 3D model used to have a humanoid skeleton. https://www.mixamo.com/ is an excellent resource for downloading pre-rigged models for free, and it also has a tool for automated rigging.
